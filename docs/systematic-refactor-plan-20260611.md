# Systematic Refactor Plan - 2026-06-11

## Purpose

Coordinate safe refactor, cleanup, and governance work for ZsxqCrawler without changing business
logic, public APIs, response shapes, config semantics, task behavior, SQL side effects, prompts, or
fallback compatibility.

This is the active plan for the next work rounds. Keep each implementation slice small, verified,
and committed independently.

## Baseline

Observed on 2026-06-11:

- `git status --short` shows only out-of-scope root `tmp_stock_analysis_*` files.
- `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests`: 506 tests passed, 15 skipped.
- `npm --prefix frontend run build`: passed.
- `uv run python scripts\scan_postgres_compat_debt.py`: no SQLite compatibility patterns found.
- The previous `docs/module-refactor-execution-plan-20260610.md` is a completed plan and should
  remain as historical evidence, not the active execution plan.

## Guardrails

- Work directly on `main`.
- Stage and commit only files touched for the current slice.
- Do not modify root `tmp_stock_analysis_*` files unless cleanup is explicitly requested.
- Do not remove legacy or fallback behavior without proof that it is unreachable, unused, or fully
  covered by equivalent behavior.
- Add characterization tests before refactoring behavior that touches tasks, fallback paths,
  storage, crawler IO, AI output shape, config defaults, or public route responses.
- Prefer pure helper extraction, row/payload mapper extraction, and hook/presentation boundaries
  before larger module moves.

## Legacy And Fallback Register

| Area | Current role | Default action | Verification guard |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Topic source `legacy` | Explicit cookie crawler path behind `topicSource=legacy` and legacy aliases | Keep | Crawl route tests and official topic tests |
| Official topic path | Default topic crawl path when configured | Keep | Official topic client tests |
| Group local fallback | Keeps group detail usable when official lookup fails | Keep | Group route helper tests |
| A-share local CSV fallback | Allows analysis to continue if PostgreSQL storage is unavailable | Keep | A-share service helper tests |
| `db_compat.py` | Narrow PostgreSQL connection and row-adaptation compatibility layer | Keep | Compatibility debt scan and storage tests |
| File downloader retry fallback | Handles retryable API, HTTP, and signed URL failures | Keep | Downloader helper tests |
| Task SSE fallback polling | Keeps frontend task status live when SSE closes or fails | Keep | Frontend build and task UI checks |

## Refactor Backlog

| Priority | Files or modules | Purpose | Risk | Verification | New tests | Legacy/fallback handling |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | Root `tmp_stock_analysis_*` files | Inventory only | Low | `git status --short` | No | Preserve |
| P1 | `backend/services/file_workflow_service.py` | Extract file listing filters, pagination, row mapping, and status helpers | Medium | `py_compile`; `tests.test_file_routes_helpers` | Yes | Preserve task status, response fields, error messages, paths, and side effects |
| P2 | `backend/storage/zsxq_database.py` | Extract topic/detail row mappers and payload builders | Medium | `tests.test_zsxq_database_helpers`; PG smoke only if SQL changes | Yes | Do not change schema, `db_compat.py`, runtime DDL, or compat method names |
| P3 | `backend/storage/zsxq_columns_database.py` | Extract column topic/comment row mappers | Medium | `tests.test_zsxq_columns_database_helpers`; column service tests | Yes | Preserve commit order and return shapes |
| P4 | `backend/crawlers/topic_pagination.py`, `backend/services/crawl_service.py` | Clarify pagination and official-vs-legacy source boundaries | Medium-high | Crawl route tests; official topic tests | Yes | Isolate legacy path before considering removal |
| P5 | `backend/services/task_runtime.py`, `backend/storage/task_store.py`, `frontend/src/hooks/useTaskStatus.ts` | Reduce global task-runtime state and align frontend polling/SSE behavior | High | Task tests; frontend build; manual task smoke if UI changes | Yes | Preserve cancellation, terminal ordering, lock release, and fallback polling |
| P6 | `frontend/src/lib/api/types.ts`, `frontend/src/lib/api/*` | Split API type surface by domain while keeping compatibility facade | Medium | `npm --prefix frontend run build` | Maybe | Keep `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` exports |
| P7 | `frontend/package.json`, `pyproject.toml` | Audit suspicious direct dependencies in isolated slices | Low-medium | `npm ls`; frontend build; lock diff review | No | Do not mix dependency cleanup with behavior refactors |
| P8 | `README.md`, `docs/project-architecture-roadmap.md` | Keep docs aligned with final module boundaries and verification commands | Low | grep references; relevant tests/builds | No | Archive stale plans only when cleanup is in scope |

## First Execution Slice

Start with P1 because it has clear tests, local helper seams, and lower blast radius than crawler,
storage, or task-runtime changes.

Planned slice:

1. Add characterization coverage for `_get_files_response` query-shape and pagination behavior.
2. Extract pure file-listing query helpers inside `backend/services/file_workflow_service.py` or a
   small companion helper module if the code clearly benefits.
3. Keep SQL text, parameters, response fields, pagination math, and analysis-status fallback
   behavior unchanged.

Verification:

```powershell
uv run python -m py_compile backend/services/file_workflow_service.py
uv run python -m unittest tests.test_file_routes_helpers -v
```

Full gate after 2-3 slices:

```powershell
uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests
npm --prefix frontend run build
uv run python scripts\scan_postgres_compat_debt.py
git status --short
```

## Execution Log

### 2026-06-11 - P1 file listing helper extraction

Changed:

- Added characterization coverage for `_get_files_response` completed-status filtering, search
  parameter expansion, pagination shape, AI-analysis fields, and local-path status resolution.
- Extracted file-list filters, list/count query builders, row normalization, and response assembly
  from `_get_files_response` inside `backend/services/file_workflow_service.py`.

Behavior impact:

- Intended behavior change: none.
- Public route signature, response fields, SQL filter semantics, analysis-status semantics,
  pagination math, and local-path resolution behavior are preserved.
- No legacy or fallback behavior was removed.

Verification:

```powershell
uv run python -m py_compile backend\services\file_workflow_service.py
uv run python -m unittest tests.test_file_routes_helpers -v
uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests
npm --prefix frontend run build
uv run python scripts\scan_postgres_compat_debt.py
```

Result:

- Focused file route helper tests passed: 29 tests.
- Full backend tests passed: 507 tests, 15 skipped.
- Frontend build passed.
- PostgreSQL compatibility debt scan found no SQLite compatibility patterns.

## Stop Conditions

Pause before editing if:

- New tracked changes appear in files targeted by the current slice.
- A test failure appears outside the edited area and is not clearly pre-existing.
- The slice requires route field, schema, prompt, task status, lock, retry, or config semantic
  changes.
- The implementation grows into a broad rewrite instead of a boundary-preserving extraction.
